[Unit]
Description=Writerdeck Neovim Session (Kiosk Mode)
# Ensure this service starts after user sessions are ready and network is online.
After=systemd-user-sessions.service network-online.target
# This service "wants" the network to be online, but won't fail if it's not (due to Wants=).
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
# Run the service as the 'writer' user.
User=writer
Group=writer
# Use PAM for authentication (standard login process).
PAMName=login
# Run the graphical session on TTY1 (the first virtual console).
TTY=1
# This is the core command that launches your writerdeck.
# It tells 'cage' (the Wayland kiosk compositor) to launch '/usr/bin/ptyxis'
# The '--' separates 'cage' arguments from the application it should launch.
# The '-e /usr/bin/nvim' tells Ptyxis to immediately execute Neovim.
# You can add '--debug' to 'cage' for initial troubleshooting, then remove it.
ExecStart=/usr/bin/cage -- /usr/bin/ptyxis -e /usr/bin/nvim
# Ensure standard input/output/error are connected to the TTY for interaction.
StandardInput=tty
StandardOutput=inherit
StandardError=inherit
# Optionally, configure the service to restart if it crashes, enhancing robustness.
# Restart=always
# RestartSec=5s

[Install]
# This service should be started when the graphical target is reached.
# By setting it as the default target in the Containerfile, it effectively
# becomes the primary boot target for the system.
WantedBy=graphical.target
